Hi! I'm still working on this project but here is a few words about it. <br>
Besides programming, I also crochet. My small business is called Jukietki – just like this project. <br>
Sometimes I receive many orders and have trouble tracking how much I spend and earn, so I decided to build my own CRM system to manage it better. <br>
It's my first solo project. I’ve previously created a CRM with my friends Kuba and Bartek for the company INVESTIT-SYSTEMS – it's called giganci-crm. <br>
In this project I focused on creating simple and clear interface. It's also a way for me to practice and reinforce what I’ve already learned. <br>
